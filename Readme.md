## Overview

This POC showcases how personalized content can be dynamically updated in Contentful based on external data, such as customer behavior, marketing campaigns, and product recommendations from Salesforce Data Cloud or any other data provider.

### Key Features:
- **Dynamic Content Updates**: Content in Contentful is automatically updated via API calls based on the incoming data from external sources.
- **Contentful Management API**: Used to manage and update content entries in Contentful.
- **Real-time Personalization**: Personalized content can be tailored and displayed to users based on predefined parameters, e.g., target audience or user segments.

### Use Case:
- An e-commerce platform updates its homepage banners and offers based on real-time data like user demographics, browsing behavior, or campaign status. The platform can then display personalized content directly in the userâ€™s session.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js & Express.js**: Backend API to process data and update Contentful content dynamically.
- **Contentful**: CMS for storing and managing dynamic content.
- **Salesforce Data Cloud** (or any external data provider): For providing the data that triggers content updates.
- **Postman**: To test the API endpoints and simulate real-time content updates.
- **Contentful Delivery API**: To retrieve the updated content on the frontend.

## Project Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- Contentful Account and API Access
- Postman for API testing

### External Data Sources (Not Needed for POC)
- Salesforce Data Cloud
- Snowflake
- Redshift

### Install Dependencies
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repository.git
   cd your-repository
   ```

2. Install the required Node.js dependencies:
   ```bash
   yarn add
   ```

3. Set up your `.env` file with Contentful and Salesforce Data Cloud API credentials:
   ```bash
   CONTENTFUL_SPACE_ID=<your_space_id>
   CONTENTFUL_ACCESS_TOKEN=<your_access_token>
   CONTENTFUL_MANAGEMENT_ACCESS_TOKEN=<your_management_access_token>
   ```

4. Start the application:
   ```bash
   yaen start
   ```

## Contentful Integration

1. **Content Model**: 
   - Created a `Personalization` content type in Contentful with the following fields:
     - `title`: The title of the personalized content.
     - `description`: The content description (can be updated dynamically).
     - `targetAudience`: An array of target audience categories.
     - `bannerImage`: A link to an asset (image).
     - `buttonText`: The text for the button.
     - `buttonLink`: The URL the button links to.
     - `active`: Boolean to indicate if the content is active.

2. **Content Entry**:
   - Content entries are created using the Contentful Management API. The backend updates these entries based on external data (e.g., campaign data or user segment info).

3. **API Endpoint**:
   - A POST endpoint `/personalize` listens for incoming payloads containing personalization data. The backend updates the respective fields in Contentful entries using the Contentful Management API.

## API & Backend

### Backend API
The backend is built using Node.js and Express.js. The main API endpoint is:

- **POST /personalize**
  - Updates content in Contentful based on the incoming JSON payload.
  - Example payload:
    ```json
    {
      "title": "Holiday Sale",
      "description": "Up to 50% off on selected items!",
      "targetAudience": ["new users", "premium members"],
      "bannerImage": "<asset_link>",
      "buttonText": "Shop Now",
      "buttonLink": "/sale",
      "active": true
    }
    ```

### Logic:
- The backend first validates the incoming payload.
- It then uses the Contentful Management API to update the content of the relevant entry.
- The content is published after the update, making it available to be fetched by the frontend.

### Testing the POC

1. **Postman**:
   - Use Postman to test the `/personalize` API endpoint by sending POST requests with sample payloads to simulate content updates.
   - The API updates the content in Contentful, and the changes are visible in real-time in your app (depending on your content delivery strategy).

2. **Check Contentful**:
   - After updating content via API, log into Contentful and check the entry for the `Personalization` content type. Ensure the fields reflect the changes made through the API.

## Next Steps

1. **Scalability**:
   - Implement caching mechanisms to optimize the real-time delivery of content.
   - Integrate with additional data sources to enrich personalization capabilities.

2. **Frontend Integration**:
   - Integrate this system with your frontend (e.g., a React or Next.js app) to dynamically load and display personalized content.
   - Implement real-time fetching to update the content on the client side.

3. **Security**:
   - Ensure API security by using authentication mechanisms like OAuth or API keys to protect the endpoints.
   - Implement rate-limiting and input validation to prevent abuse.

4. **Performance Monitoring**:
   - Implement logging and monitoring to track the performance and errors of the backend.
   - Consider integrating with tools like Datadog, Sentry, or CloudWatch for monitoring API usage and errors.
